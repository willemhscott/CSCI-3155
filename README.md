# Readings and In-Class Lecture Notes for CSCI 3155
## Sriram Sankaranarayanan (Computer Science, CU Boulder)
This repository contains the jupyter scala notebooks for CSCI 3155.
We will distribute the notebooks for each week as jupyter scala notebooks.
The repository also contains the notebooks that were used during lectures.

- Regularly use git pull to keep yourself up to date with the repo.
- The repository mirrors information already posted on our class moodle. This will
be updated in a more lazy manner. If in a pinch, please use the class moodle.


## Sources and Credits

The notebooks form the official "textbook" for this class.  Sriram Sankaranarayanan
is the author of these notebooks, and takes full responsibility/blame for their
contents. The goal was originally to translate the wonderful book:
- Essentials of Programming Languages by Friedman and Wand
into the Scala language used in our class as lecture notes. However, things
have acquired a life of their own in the meantime.

Sriram is grateful to Prof. Bor-Yuh Evan Chang for providing structure and
designing this class. These lecture notes also owe a debt to Prof. Chang's own notes.

Spencer Wilson contributed comments/critique and many of the in class notebooks.

The notebooks have evolved thanks to comments by current and past TAs including
Albert Dayn, David Moon, Kyle Headley, Jack Martin, Monal Narasimhamurthy, and
Rohit Mehra. Special acknowledgment to Stacey Hayes.

## How to view these notebooks

Students registered in the class can use the official CSCI Virtual Machine.
Setup instructions for Jupyter notebook and the scala kernel are provided.

If you do not have access to these VMs, please install jupyter notebook, scala
IDEs (including compiler, scala build tools) and the Almond kernel for
scala: https://github.com/almond-sh/almond.
It works well with Java 1.8 and anecdotally can work with Java 1.9.

Post on the Piazza page for help.

__Note:__ Although github has a viewer for these notebooks, it often cannot render
some of the characters very well.  Thus, the output looks distorted with "Unknown Character"
all over the place. Cloning and viewing on your own jupyter notebook viewer is the best way.
