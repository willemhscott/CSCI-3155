Keep the picture below in mind as you think of how a stack machine works.\n",

    "- `LoadIns(identifier)`: Pop off the top element of the stack. Let the number popped off be `v`. Update the environment by mapping `identifier` to `v`. If the identifier does not already exist a new binding is added, otherwise, the existing binding is shadowed by the new binding.\n",
    "  - Example: Stack has top element `20.9`. The instruction `LoadIns(\"x\")` removes the top element off the stack and updates the environment by adding the binding `\"x\" -> 20.9`.  \n",
    "- `StoreIns(identifier)`: Take the value that `identifier` maps to in the environment (if `identifier` is not present, then throw an exception). Let the value be `v`. Push `v` onto the top of the stack.\n",
    "  - Example: `StoreIns(\"what\")` will look up the environment for the value `what`, say `4.3`. It will push `4.3` onto the top of stack. Environment is unchanged by this operation. \n",
    "- `PushIns(d)`: push the number d onto the stack.\n",
    "- `PopIns`: pop off the top element of the stack - throw an exception if the stack is empty.\n",
    "- `AddIns`: pop two numbers from the stack, add them and push the result back to the stack. Throw an exception if the stack is empty during any of the pop operations.\n",
    "- `SubIns`: pop two numbers from the stack: let the first number popped be `v1` and second number be `v2`, subtract them as `v2 - v1` (this order is very important) and push the result back to the stack. Throw an exception if the stack is empty during any of the pop operations.\n",
    "- `MultIns`: pop two numbers from the stack, multiply them and push the result back to the stack. Throw an exception if the stack is empty during any of the pop operations.\n",
    "- `DivIns`: pop two numbers from the stack, let the first number popped be `v1` and second number be `v2`, divide them as `v2 / v1` (this order is very important)  and push the result back to the stack. Throw an exception if the stack is emptyduring any of the pop operations. Throw exception if division by zero.\n",
    "- `LogIns`: pop _one_ number from the stack, compute its log if positive and push the result back onto the stack. If non-positive throw an exception. Throw an exception if the stack is empty during any of the pop operations.\n",
    "- `ExpIns`: pop _one_ number from the stack, compute its exponential $e^x$ and push the result back onto the stack.  Throw an exception if the stack is empty during any of the pop operations\n",
    "- `SineIns/CosineIns`: pop _one_ number from the stack, compute its sin/cos respectively, and push the result back onto the stack.  Throw an exception if the stack is empty during any of the pop operations.\n",
